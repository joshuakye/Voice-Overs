			<h1>Origins</h1>
			<p>I dedicate this project to a hobby, and one that I have discovered relatively recently and have grown quite fond of: 
				<strong>Voice Overs</strong>. The realm of voice overs can span a wide variety of different specializations and professions. Voice over is something that is all around us on practically a daily basis, and it can be easy to take for granted and even to forget that there are people behind the scenes making it all possible. I am no means a professional as of yet, but I could definitely see myself doing this sort of thing part-time in any capacity. For now, I will share some backstory into my journey with voice overs as well as some of the things I have done within it thus far.</p>
			
			<!--Introduction-->
			<p>It started in my senior year of high school. Up until this point, I was quite a bit on the introverted side and also had social anxiety to an extent. He really challenged both me and my class to put ourselves out there. That entire year was truly a journey, one in which the results were quite tangible. With every new thing we learned about , from improv to recreating scenes from movies to directing our own scenes to storytelling, we all slowly broke ourselves out of our shells. This all culminated with a final showcase that Spring before our graduations where we recreated the most memorable parts of the year for our family and friends, which I was part of as well, with storytelling. We had all changed so much throughout the year, and for the better. My drama teacher had taught for 3 years up until that point (2015) and he wrote to us a letter which he read to all of us. He commended us on being the most changed class he'd had so far and encouraged us to continue with drama and acting however we could.</p>

			<p>Why is this story important? Well as a performer in any sort of medium, one has to be comfortable in one's own skin and loose, so to speak, in order to be able to deliver a compelling performance. Despite having broken out of my shell, so to speak, I was still not the most comfortable with doing live camera work, but my interest in the performing arts led me to discovering about voice acting in particular. It has an interesting dynamic where the person behind a character cannot be seen but rather heard through the performer's voice and the character(s) that he or she plays. I quickly found out, however, that voice overs were not limited to voice acting, but encompassed a wide variety of professions, including but not limited to, animation, commercials, audio books, live commentary, AI (think Siri for example, which makes use of a word bank an actual person supplies), etc. I would soon delve deeper into this realm, and my journey began.</p>
