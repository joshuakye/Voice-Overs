		<h1>Voice Acting</h1>
		
		<p>Then there is, in my opinion, the most challenging subset of voice over, which is voice acting. Rather than performing on stage or on film where you have full use of your body and facial expressions to create a character, voice acting makes use of only an actor's voice to bring a character to life. Each aspect of acting has its own challenges, advantages, and disadvantages, and voice acting is what I would choose if I could be an actor of some sort.</p>

		<p>While I am a fan of voice acting in many mediums, at the moment I have the most exposure to one type of it: ADR. It stands for Automated Dialogue Replacement. In the simplest terms, it deals with media that already exists, often in a foreign language. The dialogue from the original is replaced through a series of audio mixing and replacing to create a version of the medium in the local language to be understood and watched by the native population. Within this category lies yet another subset known as dubbing, such as that of Anime, a style of animation that originated in Japan. As a semi-avid fan and watcher of the medium, I took things a step further when I decided to buckle down and work on what is known as a fandub project, which is more or less casual dubbing performed by fans of the medium.</p>

		<p>Thus far, I have only worked on one such fandub, but it was easily one of the most challenging, yet rewarding, things I have done in my life so far, mostly because there were so many things I had to learn on the fly, including Pro Tools to record the tracks, audio/video editing tracks to put it all together, adaptive scriptwork to make sure English dialogue would fit the existing animations, and proper timing and acting itself, the latter of which was the most challenging as the scene I recorded was incredibly vocally intense, involving a myriad of screams and shouts. Looking back, while I do feel a few parts could have been executed better, considering I was completely new to the entire process, I think the results were quite impressive. At the time (a little over three years now), I challenged myself to make the project look and feel as professional as possible, despite my inexperience.<br><br> To show you just how intense the scene was, here is a sample of some of the acting of the video in question. Yes, everything you are hearing is my own voice.:</p>

		<p>One of the most important tools a voice actor can have is a portfolio to show off his or her work, and in the realm of voice acting, that portfolio is in the form of a <strong>Demo Reel</strong>, which is a minute to a minute and a half long audio file that showcases a range of voices and emotions one can perform to make oneself marketable in the line of work. I do not have one as of yet, though I have been writing out a variety of scenes in my spare time and constantly editing and refining them. Though I have tried recording a few times, I have had mixed results, and I hope to get off the ground soon. It will not be a professional demo by any means, but it will at least help put myself out there.</p>

		<p>Voice acting can also cover a range of other mediums, such as Western animation, audiobooks, video games, etc. As mentioned before, while I cannot picture myself doing this full-time, it is something I can definitely see myself pursuing at least part-time. I am not particularly picky; any type of voice work would be fine, personally. The kind of creativity and satisfaction I feel working behind the microphone is something that is hard to put into words.</p>
