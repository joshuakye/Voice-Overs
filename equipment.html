	<h1>Equipment</h1>	<!--Introduction-->

	<p>Below would be an example of what a professional setup for voice-overs would look like. You have the condenser microphone outfitted with a pop filter and soundproof material strewn over the surrounding walls to ensure the best audio quality. Although I do not own anything of this quality as of yet, I have made use of one somewhat similar to it right here at university. </p>

	<p>In the 1st floor of the Oviatt Library lies a room with a clear glass door that reads "Creative Media Studio." This was added fairly recently at about 5 years ago, so just before I started attending CSUN, though I did not know about this and until the summer after my freshman year, finally making use of it in the fall of my sophmore year. <br><br> This is what the Audio Production Room in it looks like:</p>

	<p>Items worth mentioning are the condenser microphones, headsets for listening to oneself while recording, the power box that connects all the microphones and headsets to provide them all with power, and the computer that is loaded with the latest audio and video editing software.</p>

	<p>With that said, I also do some amount of recording at home, though with less stellar equipment. That said, I am generally happy with the quality of audio I am able to record mostly thanks to the help of this:</p>

	<p>It is a gaming headset known as the Sades SA-902. With a price tag at or slightly above $20, one would think it would have terrible sound quality, but it is quite the contrary. The sound it captures is top-notch, almost as if it comes built in with its own soundproofing (assuming minimal background noise), de-essing, etc. With the help of the screen recorder software OBS Studio, I have produced content for some platforms, such as YouTube and even the game streaming platform Twitch.</p>

	<p>Software both for recording and editing vocal tracks is essential to get projects going. The industry standard regarding recording software is Pro Tools, although editing software can be a little more open ended. Pro Tools is a common one for professional use, but ones for more casual editors also exist, such as Apple's iMovie software built into Macs, the latter of which I have made use of on multiple occasions.</p>

	<p>Another useful item worth mentioning is a consumable item, one that can be generalized to anyone within the realm of voice overs, and that is the <strong>green apple.</strong> Alongside vocal warmups (singing scales/song, gargling water, etc.), it is worthwhile to take a bite or two out of a green apple to get rid of any annoying clicking sounds one can produce, which can interfere with the audio quality of his or her recordings.</p>

	<p>And of course, there's water. Lots and lots of water. Speaking in front of a mic is, in a quite literal way, elaborate exhaling, and when you exhale, water escapes your body, which needs to be replenished regularly if you don't wanna dehydrate or potentially even lose for voice. Stay hydrated!</p>
